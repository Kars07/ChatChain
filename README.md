## Key Features  

### 🏛️ **DAO-Powered Group Chats**  
**No More Admin Tyranny** – Groups run democratically:  
- **Add/Remove Members** via voting (e.g., "Should we add Bob?")  
- **Change Group Settings** with proposals (e.g., "Set 24h vote duration")  
- **Transparent Voting** recorded on Polygon blockchain  
- **Custom Rules** per group (quorums, approval thresholds)  

**Example Workflow:**  
1. Alice proposes adding Bob to "Family Group"  
2. Members vote via chat buttons (✅/❌) within 24h  
3. Smart contract auto-adds Bob if 60% vote "Yes"  

### 🔒 **Military-Grade Security**  
- **End-to-End Encryption** (Signal Protocol)  
- **Biometric Wallet Login** – No passwords, just your face/fingerprint  
- **Blockchain-Verified Integrity** – Every message hash stored on Polygon  
- **Optional IPFS Backup** – Encrypted and decentralized
